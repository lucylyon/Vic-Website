to do:
--
happy anniversary picture bigger, all others even. 
everything even after pg 1
--
format pictures to be smaller when post opened
posts w/ multiple pictures (look at other themes?) 
just have all of them in a row at the top
who fuckin knows with collage posts, ask becca for advice?
maybe like rows of 4 w/ lil captions?
if captions get too long, make seperate post


ideas:

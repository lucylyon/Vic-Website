DONE

This trip was so nice. We should have weekend trip again. School is so icky and stressful, and being able to just take a break from it for a few days and spend quality time with you was so nice. It was very much needed. I loved our bath and I want to do it again, but this time we can make sure the water doesn't get cold. One day we will have a nice fancy bathtub.

You made so much yummy food. Like everything you made that weekend was amazing, and I had so much fun making pasta with you!! And then we got to eat it with yummy sauce! And bagels! And scallion pancakes! And samosas! You are such a good cook. 

I remember getting home and sitting in the parking lot for a long time crying because of how much I love you. I know I've said this many times, so I hope it's not annoying, but I am so fucking grateful for you. I have never had a relationship like this. You make me feel so safe and comfortable and loved. I know you'll always be there for my bad days, and you don't get mad at me when I have a bad day and fuck up. You are so amazing and wonderful and understanding and I do not know what I did to get so lucky.

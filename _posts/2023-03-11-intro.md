Happy Anniversary!! I love you so much, and I am so glad you stuck around for an entire year! You mean so much to me. So, here is some backstory. I was in Round Mountain working on your valentines present, but I couldn’t figure out what to write, so I decided to take a break. I need to update my website because right now it’s just bleh blog for Disco Tray, but when I’m looking for jobs it’ll need to be like resume/projects/cool shit about me. So I was looking for ideas, and I found this template and I was like oo this would be very cute for my baby. Plus it’s good practice for whenever I fix mine (that is bs but it is my way of justifying working on this instead of the 80000 things I have to do). 
 
 
I have no worked with website stuff in over two years, and even then I was not very good at it, so sorry it is not the best. I thought it would be a cute idea because Abby’s ex made them a website for their 18th birthday and it was very cute. I hope you like it. I know it’s not the fanciest or most put together, but I tried my best and I think it is cute. I hope it is good enough because I know you spent a lot of money on stuff for me, and I just made you stuff for Anniversary and Valentine’s, but I put a lot of time and thought into both of them because you like mushy sentimental stuff. 
 
Here are some cute pictures of us that I like and wanted to include:

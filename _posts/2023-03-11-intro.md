FINISH WRITING

<p><img src="/assets/images/intro/intro.jpg" width="250" height="250" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="0"> text here 

many things that werent included 
many wonderful memories with you, but here are some of my favorites, and i hope you life it 

backstory: was in round mountain working on valentines present (i hope i finished it and you liked it)bun
couldnt figure out what to write, and needed to update my website, so i was looking for cute themes
and i saw this one, and was like.. this is good template for baby.
plus it's good practice for websites (this is bs but its my way to justify working on it instead of the 80000 other things i have to do)
anyways. i love you.
oh wait. so yea.
i saw the template and was like ooo i could make a website of us for our anniversary. im hoping it gets finished. bc i started valentines but havent finished it (its early january rn)
im bad at picking up new projects but not finishing them
i hope i  finish this.

<div class="row">

<img src="/assets/images/we_cute/fair.png" width="170" height="220"  hspace="25" vspace="20">
<img src="/assets/images/we_cute/walk.png" width="200" height="250"  hspace="25" vspace="20">
</div>

i think as long as i can get the layout of everything done before classes/before shit gets hard, i should be okay
bc writing words about memories is easy, just takes time
and once i have the layout set up, i can just write it, and it'll format itself
but for now, the layout sucks. (well rn it is non existant)

literally have not worked with website stuff in at least two years, and even then i wasnt very good at it
i thought this would be a cute idea though
took it from ruchick 
i hope you like it. its not the fanciest or most put together, but i tried my best and i think its cute

also hope this is a good present. i feel bad becuase i know you spent a lot of money on fancy things for me, and i didn't spend anything for this, but i put a lot of time into it becuase i know you like mushy sentimental stuff

These are just cute picutes of us that I like and wanted to include.

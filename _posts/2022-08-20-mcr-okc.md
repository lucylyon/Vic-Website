DONE

When I got tickets, our relationship was pretty new, so I was worried I would fuck it up before the concert and it would be a problem since it was like 3-4 months away. But I didn't! And it was so fun!! I'm so glad I got to experience seeing my favorite band with you. That is so crazy to me. I never thought I would be able to see them live, especially not with the love of my life. Like that is just so cool to me and I wish I could go tell middle school me that because it would blow their mind.

Then we went to the Melting Pot! I love that place so much. I wish we had one closer. I know it probably wasn't that exciting for you, but I had so much fun and I am so glad we went. I know there's plenty of cooler things to do in OKC. But I thought it was very yummy and I liked our waitress, she was very cool. I hope she appreciated the lactaid, and I wonder if she realized we are gay and were not just having a gal pal hang out sesh. 

I liked the little coffee shop we went to beforehand. It was cute, but I remember waiting forever to get our drinks, and by the time we did, it was almost time for lunch, so there wasn't much time to drink them. You drank yours really quickly, and then finished mine becuase I drink slow and I was worried I would get anxious if I drank all that caffeine at once.

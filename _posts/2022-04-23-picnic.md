DONE

This picnic was so very cute, and I'm so happy we went on it. You weren't feeling well, so we had to push it back a bit. I was worried that you were going to beat yourself up too much about that and then we wouldn't get to go, so I'm glad you didn't. 

<div class="row">

</div>

After a while, you felt okay enough, and we got to go! And I got to give you sandwich and strawberry shortcake and hummus! And Susie came and got to splash around in the water and it was very cute. I really liked just sitting outside with you and existing. We should do that more often. Picnics are very cute. And so are you.

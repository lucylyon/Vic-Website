I loved going to Miss Hendrix with you. We looked so pretty, and I am very glad we got those pictures in the chapel!

 They are so good. Potentially my new favorite pictures of us. You took such good photos!! And everyone loved them because you are so amazing and talented. It was really cool that you got to show Symone and her manager, and they loved them too. You're so impressive. And then we went to Andy's! I like that we were both thinking about it afterwards. We are meant to be. We have the same silly little brain.

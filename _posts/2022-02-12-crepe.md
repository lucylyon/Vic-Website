I wish I had a picture of stars, but I do not. Luckily I have cute pictures from our first date!! We'd been hanging out a lot, and I wanted to go on a real date, but also I was super nervous that you would think it was only a friend hangout thing, or wouldn't want to go on a date with me. Eventually I worked up the courage to ask, and I made sure to say it was a date in case you didn't want that. And you said yes!!

 I was so nervous and excited for days. And it was really cute because we did stars the night before, which was like unoffical first date. So I was all giddy from stars, then we got to get crepes the next day! It was so exiting. And you looked so pretty! Then afterwards we went to petshoppe and I found little friend and you looked at fish and it was very nice.

I don't remember anything specific about either of these, but I thought they were very cute, so I wanted to include them. I'm pretty sure the Susie one was the day after I got her. I like all of our crepe dates, they are very nice.

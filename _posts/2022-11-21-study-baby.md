You are my study baby!! You are so smart! Working is very hard, so it is nice that I have a beautiful baby to keep me company while I work and sometimes work with me! It was really helpful when I was trying to finish my capstone last semester, and you came to Round Mountain with me, even though you were done with your finals. I like that we can be study babies together. It is very cool and smart of us.

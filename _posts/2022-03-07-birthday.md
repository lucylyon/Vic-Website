Man I was so stressed about your birthday. I really liked you, but we weren't official yet, and I didn't want to scare you off. Also I didn't know you well enough to know what to get you, and I really wanted to get you something good. Also, you had been working on my playlist for a while and I thought it was super cute, but I listen to the same album over and over until I'm sick of it, so there wasn't a whole lot of new music for me to show you. So I went through every song I had ever liked on spotify and tried to make you a cute playlist. I know it'll never compare to yours, but I hope you still like it.

 I remember talking to Abby becuase I was like what if I asked you to be my girlfriend on your birthday and they were like maybe not because then birthday is on anniversary. But also I was really impatient so I did not wait for very long after birthday becuase I wanted baby.

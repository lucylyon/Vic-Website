Man I was so stressed about your birthday. I really liked you, but we weren't official yet, and I didn't want to scare you off. Also I didn't know you well enough to know what to get you, and I really wanted to get you something good. I'm really glad you liked the sweatshirt, and I'm glad I got to celebrate another birthdat with you! I remember talking to Abby becuase I was like what if I asked you to be my girlfriend on your birthday and they were like maybe not because then birthday is on anniversary. But also I was really impatient so I did not wait for very long after birthday becuase I wanted baby.

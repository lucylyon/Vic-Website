FINISH

so cute
first time i went i was like wow this is such a cute date
took shitty ex, was meh
took you, was so nice!! you actually were intrested in them and i think we had a good time.

dinner
fancy italian place that i feel like we shouldn't have gotten in to. we walked in without a reservation and were like oh my this is fancy, but thankfully we got a table.
and the food was yummy! and i got to spend time with you and you looked so pretty! even though the waitress fell in love with you becuase you are so charming.
that pasta was really good and i had leftovers for two meals. i want more noodles.

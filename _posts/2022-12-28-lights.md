I loved getting to see the lights with you. The first time I went with Sofie, I thought it would be a very good place for a date. A few years later I took my ex and he was like meh okay and did not care at all and overall it was medicore. But you wanted to go with me, and it was so nice!! You were actually interested in the lights and I think we had a good time. I really liked watching the singing tree and dancing with my baby. It was very Hallmark of us.

And before that we got to eat very yummy food (I forgot the name of the restaurant). Honestly I feel like we shouldn't have gotten in to becuase we just walked into it without a reservation and I felt underdressed. But we got a table! And the pasta was really good and there was a lot of it so I had leftovers for two meals. And you looked gorgeous with fancy ambiance lighting. Too gorgeous though becuase you made the waitress fall in love with you because you are so charming. But I get to be your girlfriend and she doesn't. So I win.

We spent New Year's together!! It was very lovely going into new year with my baby. And we looked very cute and your dress was very sexy and sparkly. I got a New Year's kiss!! It makes this year very special! And we made yummy drinks!!

I was a big fan of the butter beer, and it's very jazzy that you made a lot of it non-alcoholic so I could have more even after party was over. I like that this picture is very similar to the one for formal. Like we are in the same position and wearing similar dresses. It is very cute. Also it was really cute when you offered to let me go on the right side becuase you remembered my right side is the cool side.

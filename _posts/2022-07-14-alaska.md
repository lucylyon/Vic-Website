I know I didn't go to Alaksa with you, but I love these pictures of you so much, so I decided to include Alaksa. One day we will go together! I missed you so much while you were in Alaska, but it was so neat to hear about all of your adventures and see some of the pictures. I know theres still some more on your camera, and hopefully I get to see them one day, and you can tell me all about them.

The picture of you with the flowers is one of my favorite pictures of you. You just look so pretty and soft and nice. All of the Alaska photos are just so good. You are so pretty.

I love your Alaska sweatshirt so much. I do not know why, but I sure do. Like I love any sweatshirt I get/steal from you, but for some reason that one is my favorite. I know it is your favorite, so maybe I will return it soon. Who knows.

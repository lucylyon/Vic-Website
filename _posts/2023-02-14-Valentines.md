last year:
didnt know if i could get you stuff bc it was very new
was planning on getting you stuff the day after as like oh well i did it bc its on sale, to try to not seem too much
you werent feeling good so i decided to get you stuff to make you feel better
it was so cute bc i was sitting in my car about to leave and you walked out with stuff for me too. 
Last year I didn't know if I could get you things because we were still very new, and I didn't want to scare you away

I got that Reeces cookie thing, but it expired before we could make it!! Boo!
But I got one this year and we got to make it! Even though I kinda took over and did it when it was supposed to be yours. But I hope you still enjoyed it. And we got to make a second one because you saved the pan from last year, and you had cookie dough in your freezer! You are so prepared.

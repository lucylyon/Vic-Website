Two valentine's together? Hell yea. Last year, I didn't know if I could get you things for Valentine's day because it was very new and we weren't official yet, and I didn't want to scare you away. But then you weren't feeling good so I decided fuck it, you deserve to be treated right, so I'm going to do it anyways. I was sitting in my car after I snuck in and dropped it off, and as I was about to leave, you came out with stuff for me!! It was so nice. I remember posting the flowers on my story as a suble flex of I have a pretty girl who got me flowers for valentines day.

This year was very nice too! I really hope you liked the letters, and I hope this isn't too similar. The crocs were super cute and I wear them a lot more than I expected, which is cool. And we finally got to make the Reece's cookie thing, since it expired last year before we could make it. It was so fun even though I kinda took over and did it when it was supposed to be yours. But I hope you still enjoyed it. And we got to make a second one because you saved the pan from last year, and you had cookie dough in your freezer! You are so prepared.

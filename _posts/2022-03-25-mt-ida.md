This is the first time that I remember hanging out with you. I had hung out with you and Becca a few times, and I knew of you, but that was about it. I was organzing my room and I didn't want to do it alone, so I asked if you wanted to come lay on my floor and you did!! At that point I was like you seem cool and cute and I want to be friends with you, but I was worried about it because I am bad at making friends and I didn't want you to think I was weird. I am very glad you came over.</p>

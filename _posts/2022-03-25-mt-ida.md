This trip was so nice. I loved being able to get away and spend time with you, Joey, and Bex. It was nice meeting your siblings, but I feel like I did not make a good impression and they hated me. Oh well. I got to snuggle with my baby so much! It was so good. We need to do that again. And you cooked so much good food!! And I got to make fondue! That was very fun. I want to make fondue again. What if we got that fondue from kroger... It was yummy and easy (like me)

We went rock shopping and it was so cool. There was so many cool rocks. And I got a geode and they smashed it! And Bex and I dyed Susan and she looked very silly, and then she got to ride around in the four wheeler and see the world.

We took cute family photos!! I love all of them so much. The ones in front of the cabin with us and Susan are my favorites. I also love the ones with us and Becca. We are a cute little family.

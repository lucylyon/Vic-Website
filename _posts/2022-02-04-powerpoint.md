around the time of playlist
powerpoint about me - it was very cute
i was worried i scared you off by telling you i didnt want you to present it
i love it when im the center of attention with you, but other people are scary
i didnt want you to take that as i thought it was weird - i very much did not
you left early on in the party and i was sad bc i wanted to spend time with you and i wanted to take care of you and protect you, but i wasnt what you needed at the time
i tried to give you space, but im so grateful i don't have to do that anymore. im glad you let me take care of you

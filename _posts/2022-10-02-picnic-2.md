We went on another picnic!! Picnics are so nice. You spend so much time making such good for me, and we got to use your fancy picnic set! The pretzels were so yummy. Maybe I get to eat those again one day. And you made me corn! Becuase I was in a hardcore elote phase. And I think that is also when you made that smore's-y rice krispy thing. That was also delicious. Literally everything you made was so good.

I cried so much because I have never felt so loved before. You spent so much time trying to figure out what I would like, and making it for me. It meant so much to me. I've never had anyone try that hard for me before. Then I got all mushy because you are so thoughtful and make me feel safe, and the picnic was just one of the many ways you did that. Also that pink skirt is so cute, and you look very nice in it. Very fuckable.

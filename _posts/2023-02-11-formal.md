DONE

We've gone to two formals together!! How cool is that! The pictures we took last year are definitly some of my favorites. I do not remember much from formal last year besides us going and being cute.

I am so glad you are so kind and understanding. This year formal was very loud and overwhelming, but I didn't want to leave and ruin it for you. But you sat with me outside! And you let me settle down after loud scary place. If you hadn't been there, it would have been so much worse. I definitly would not have been able to go back.

The three of us need to spend more time together. It is very nice. I am so glad you and Becca were friends and that now I get to date you!! Becca did good with that one. </p> -->
